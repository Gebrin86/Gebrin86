## Why Cybersecurity?  
Every industry is now a target, and I want to be part of the frontline defense — detecting and stopping threats before they cause damage. I’m currently preparing for **CompTIA Security+**, learning how to protect networks, devices, and sensitive data, while practicing hands-on labs in:  
- Linux administration (users, permissions, logs, services)  
- Network traffic analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump  
- Log review and incident response basics

 Learning Goals (2025)

Even though I’m learning drones and cybersecurity separately, I believe both paths will eventually cross — and in tech, it always pays to explore a little bit of everything. I'm focused on building a strong, practical foundation in both areas.

  Cybersecurity Focus
Exploring tools, techniques, and concepts used in real-world security operations:

    Python – Automating simple scripts for analysis and reconnaissance

    Network Traffic Analysis – Learning how to inspect and understand data flows

    Hands-On Tools – Getting familiar with packet crafting (Scapy), log review, and basic threat detection

    Security+ Study – Building core knowledge across confidentiality, integrity, access control, and network defense

  Drone Technology Focus
Developing skills related to flight control, UAV monitoring, and real-time data:

    Mission Planner – Planning and tracking autonomous flights

    MAVLink – Understanding how drones communicate and receive instructions

    Object Detection – Using tools like YOLOv8 to identify visuals through drone feeds

    Airspace Awareness – Factoring in weather, maps, and safe flight zones

    UAV Footage Review – Observing video for use cases like inspection or situational awareness
