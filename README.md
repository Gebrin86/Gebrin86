## About Me  

Iâ€™m currently transitioning my career path into **cybersecurity**. For the past several years, Iâ€™ve worked as a **Building Engineer**, responsible for keeping critical systems running smoothly in high-pressure environments. That role required **system reliability, quick troubleshooting, and attention to detail** â€” qualities that are just as important in cybersecurity.  

While Iâ€™m not a professional in the field yet, Iâ€™m actively learning and building my foundation step by step. My focus right now is on:  
- **Linux administration** (users, permissions, logs, services)  
- **Network traffic analysis** with Wireshark & tcpdump  
- **Security operations & incident response basics**  

Iâ€™m pursuing **CompTIA Security+** to gain a strong baseline in security concepts, while also practicing hands-on labs to understand how threats are detected and mitigated in real environments.  

My goal is to show employers that Iâ€™m committed to this new career path, learning the fundamentals, and applying my problem-solving background to become an effective cybersecurity professional.
