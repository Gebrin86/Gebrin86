## 🧠 About Me

I’m transitioning from a hands-on Building Engineer role to a career in cybersecurity. My main focus is understanding how wireless networks (especially in drones) can be monitored, analyzed, and secured.

I'm exploring the cybersecurity field through **real-world drone traffic analysis**, using tools like Mission Planner, Wireshark, and MAVProxy — without writing code yet.

## 🚀 Active Project (In Progress)

### 📡 Drone Communications Recon & Wireless Traffic Capture

- Sniffing MAVLink protocol traffic using **Wireshark**
- Using **MAVProxy** and **Mission Planner** to observe flight control and telemetry
- Recording and analyzing drone network traffic for potential weaknesses

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

To build my skills further and gain hands-on experience, I'm setting out to learn:

- 🧠 **OpenCV** – Computer vision for object detection and video analysis
- 📦 **Scapy** – For packet crafting and network scanning
- 🤖 **TensorFlow** – To understand AI-based threat detection
- 🎯 **YOLOv8** – For real-time object detection on UAV camera feeds
- 🐍 **Python** – To eventually automate and script analysis tools

---

## 🧰 Tools I Use (No Coding Required)

- **Wireshark** – Network traffic monitoring
- **Mission Planner** – UAV flight control software
- **MAVProxy** – UAV command line interface
- **Windows/Linux CLI** – Basic terminal commands for recon
