## About Me

Iâ€™m a building engineer with 10+ years of hands-on experience maintaining reliable, efficient building systems in commercial environments. My day-to-day has included HVAC troubleshooting, building automation system (BAS) monitoring, vendor and contractor coordination, preventive and corrective maintenance, and supervision of cleaning crews and on-site security â€” all with an emphasis on keeping occupants safe and facilities operating smoothly.

Lately Iâ€™ve shifted my focus toward sustainability and data-driven facility management. Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how operational changes can lower costs and reduce environmental impact, and I want to bridge my practical building knowledge with strong analytical skills to help organizations measure and improve building performance. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m developing capabilities in Linux, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau â€” tools that let me gather, clean, and visualize building and energy data so decisions are clear, measurable, and impactful.

This GitHub is my portfolio to document projects, analysis, dashboards, and workflows that demonstrate how facility operations and sustainability goals can align through data.

## Why Sustainability?

Buildings are major consumers of energy and resources, and small operational improvements can yield big returns â€” financially and environmentally. I want to help organizations reduce energy use, improve occupant comfort, and meet sustainability targets by combining my operational experience with practical analytics. My approach is hands-on and results-oriented: collect the right data, analyze trends, communicate actionable findings, and track improvements over time.
